   - [ ] Explore additional sources for historical weather data.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - [ ] Handle missing values in the dataset.
   - [ ] Convert data types as necessary (e.g., datetime conversion).
   - [ ] Extract relevant features for model training.

3. Model Training:
   - [ ] Choose a machine learning model for weather prediction.
   - [ ] Implement code for splitting data into training and testing sets.
   - [ ] Train the chosen model on the training data.

4. Model Evaluation:
   - [ ] Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics.
   - [ ] Document the evaluation results.

5. Integration with OpenWeather API:
   - [ ] Register for an API key on OpenWeatherMap.
   - [ ] Write code to fetch current weather data using the API.
   - [ ] Handle errors and rate limits when making API requests.

6. Deployment as an API:
   - [ ] Create Flask or Django API endpoints for weather predictions.
   - [ ] Deploy the API on a server (e.g., AWS, Heroku).

7. Testing and Refinement:
   - [ ] Test the prediction app thoroughly.
   - [ ] Gather feedback and refine the model or API as needed.
